# GreedyAlgorithm
Greedy algorithm---> always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. This means that it makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally-optimal solution.

Applications of Greedy Algorithm:
*Finding Optimal Solution
1.Minimum Spanning Tree 
        a.Prims Algorithm
        b.Kruskal's Algorithm
2.Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest paths from a single source
3.Huffman codes ( data-compression codes )
4.Job sequencing
5.Fractional Knapsack
6.Dijkstra's Algorithm
7.Activity Selection
